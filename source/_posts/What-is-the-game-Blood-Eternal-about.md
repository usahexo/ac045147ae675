#  Who created Blood Eternal?

Blood Eternal was created by a team of developers known as “The Flesh”. The Flesh is composed of four developers: J. T. McDermott, Michael Nickles, David Waite, and James Wood.

Each member of The Flesh has a specific role within the team. McDermott is the project lead and programmer, Nickles is the artist and lead level designer, Waite is the composer and sound engineer, and Wood is the writer and narrative director.

Blood Eternal was created as a spiritual successor to the popular flash game Crypt of the NecroDancer. The team wanted to create an action RPG that blended dungeon crawling with rhythm based gameplay.

The game was initially pitched to Kickstarter in 2015, but was unsuccessful in raising enough funds to be greenlit. Undeterred, the team continued development and eventually secured a publishing deal with Adult Swim Games in early 2017.

The game released on PC in March of 2018 to critical acclaim.
