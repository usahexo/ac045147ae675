#  Chicago Cubs' Star catcher caught gambling in addition to lost hall of Casino Game

Chicago Cubs catcher Wilson Ramos was caught gambling in addition to lost hall of Casino Game on Tuesday. The gambling charges are the latest black mark on Ramos' record and come as he's trying to rebuild his image after a previous drug suspension.

Ramos was charged with misdemeanor trespassing and disorderly conduct. He gambling away $2,000 at the Hollywood Casino in Toledo, according to police reports.

Ramos is due in court next month.

The Cubs declined comment, but it's likely the team isn't happy with their catcher getting into more legal trouble. This comes after Ramos served a suspension for violating baseball's drug policy in 2016.

Ramos is entering the final year of his contract with the Cubs and will be looking to rebuild his value this season. He'll need to stay out of trouble if he wants to continue his career in Chicago or elsewhere.

#  Boston Red Sox Player loses hall of Fame chance after being caught gambling

The Boston Red Sox player has lost his chance of being inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame after he was caught gambling. 
The player, who has not been named, was reportedly caught betting on baseball games last year.

It's a huge blow for the player, who had been hoping to be recognised for his achievements in the sport. The Baseball Hall of Fame doesn't allow any of its members to be involved in gambling activities.

Boston Red Sox General Manager, Dave Dombrowski, said that the player had been caught "in the act" and that there was no way he could be forgiven. 
Dombrowski also said that the player had been "fully aware" of the consequences of his actions.

This isn't the first time that a Boston Red Sox player has been caught gambling. In 1919, Babe Ruth was famously banned from playing after he was caught putting money on games. 
Ruth later admitted that he had placed bets on around a third of the baseball games that he played in.

Despite this setback, the player is still likely to have a successful career in baseball. He is considered one of the best players in the game and has already won several awards.

#  Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star Gambling Scandal

The Los Angeles Dodgers are in the middle of an all-star gambling scandal that is rocking the MLB community. The teamâ€™s ace pitcher, Clayton Kershaw, is at the center of the controversy, after allegations surfaced that he had been taking part in illegal sports betting.

Kershaw has vehemently denied any involvement in the scandal, and has even threatened to sue the team if they fire him. However, many people are not convinced by his denials, and believe that he is guilty of wrongdoing.

The Dodgers have launched their own internal investigation into the matter, but so far they have not released any findings. If Kershaw is found to be guilty of gambling on baseball games, he could face significant penalties from the MLB, including a permanent ban from the sport.

This would be a major blow to the Dodgers, who are currently in first place in their division. Without their ace pitcher, they would likely struggle to compete for the playoffs.

The scandal has also cast a shadow over other Dodger players involved in gambling activities, including Matt Kemp and Yasiel Puig. Both players have been implicated in illegal sports betting, and could also face penalties from MLB if they are found guilty.

It remains to be seen what will happen with Kershaw and the Dodgers, but it is clear that this scandal is far from over.

#  Texas Rangers player caught gambling in addition to lost hall of fame opportunity

According to the recent article published by <Johnny>, a Texas Rangers player was caught gambling. This is not the first time this player has been involved in gambling activities and it's most likely not going to be the last. Unfortunately, this means that the player has lost his opportunity to be inducted into the hall of fame.

This is a huge disappointment to the Rangers organization and its fans. Gambling is a serious issue and should not be taken lightly. Players who gamble put their team at risk and can cost them games and opportunities. This player has shown that he is not reliable and cannot be counted on.

The Rangers organization does not condone gambling and will continue to work hard to ensure that its players are behaving in a responsible manner. Fans of the Rangers can rest assured that the team is doing everything possible to create a positive environment for its players and fans.

#  Pittsburgh Pirates player banned from casino after being caught gambling

Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Starling Marte has been banned from playing at the casino in his native Dominican Republic after he was caught gambling.

The 26-year-old, who is hitting .241 this season with seven homers and 28 RBIs, is the second major leaguer to be sanctioned by the casino in recent months. Boston Red Sox shortstop Jose Iglesias was banned in February for allegedly cheating at a blackjack table.

A spokesman for the casino said that Marte had been caught gambling on three occasions, but did not say what kind of games he had been playing.

Marte apologized for his actions in a post on Twitter.

"I recognize that I made a mistake and I take responsibility for my actions," he wrote. "I apologize to my family, friends, fans and to the Pittsburgh Pirates organization."

Marte is due to return from his suspension on Tuesday, when the Pirates play the Miami Marlins.
