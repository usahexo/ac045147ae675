#  Crvena zvezda takes on Partizan with one of their blackjack dealers in the hot seat!

The Crvena zvezda and Partizan Belgrade match is set to be one of the most exciting fixtures of the season. But it won't just be the players on the pitch who are looking to make an impact.

One member of the Crvena zvezda staff will be under particular scrutiny - their blackjack dealer!

This is because their dealer, Sanja, is facing allegations of cheating from Partizan supporters.

Sanja has been working as a blackjack dealer for Crvena zvezda for over two years and has always been considered a reliable and trustworthy member of staff.

However, recent allegations from Partizan fans suggest that she has been dealing unfairly against them, giving Crvena zvezda an advantage.

Partizan have released a statement demanding that Sanja be removed from her position and replaced with a fair dealer.

Crvena zvezda have since issued a statement of their own, denying all allegations against Sanja and vowing to support her throughout this process.

#  Blackjack dealer salary: How much do they make at Crvena zvezda? 

There are a lot of casino games that people can play, but one of the most popular is blackjack. It is a game that is easy to understand, but can be difficult to win. This is why there are dealers in charge of the game. They help maintain order and make sure that all the players are following the rules. But what is the salary of a blackjack dealer?

Generally, blackjack dealers make around $10 an hour. However, this can vary depending on the casino you work for. Plus, with tips, you can make significantly more than this amount. 

If you are looking to become a blackjack dealer, there are a few things that you need to know. One, you will need to have some experience dealing cards. Two, you will need to be able to keep track of multiple games at once. And three, you will need to be able to handle stress well.

#  Could a blackjack dealer make more money at another casino? 

A blackjack dealer’s salary varies depending on their casino, but they could make more elsewhere. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) shows that blackjack dealers earned a median wage of $22,610 in 2018. This wage is above the national median wage of $18,500, but not by much.

The average salary for a blackjack dealer also varies depending on their casino. Casino Compass shows that the average salary for a blackjack dealer at a Las Vegas casino is $25,000 per year. However, the average salary at an Atlantic City casino is only $19,000 per year. So, a blackjack dealer could potentially make more money at a Las Vegas casino than an Atlantic City casino. 

There are several reasons for this discrepancy in salaries. For one, Atlantic City casinos are struggling financially and are having to reduce costs wherever possible. This means that employees are often paid less than their counterparts at Las Vegas casinos. Additionally, the types of casinos available vary from state to state. So, if you want to become a blackjack dealer, it’s important to research what the average salary is in your area.
