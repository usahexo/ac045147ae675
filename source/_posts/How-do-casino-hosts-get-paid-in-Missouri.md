#  How do casino hosts get paid in Missouri?

Casino hosts in Missouri are paid differently than in other states. In most states, casino hosts are paid a percentage of the amount of money they bring in to the casino. However, in Missouri, hosts are paid a flat salary.

The reason for this is that Missouri has a lottery system that allows people to bet on sporting events. Casino hosts in other states argue that they should be compensated based on the money they bring in, as they are in other states. But the Missouri Gaming Commission feels that hosts should be paid a salary to ensure that they are not influenced by the potential for financial gain when working with guests.

In addition, casino hosts in Missouri are not allowed to accept gifts from guests or offer any special treatment in exchange for betting at the casino. This is also done to avoid any potential conflicts of interest.

#  What is the typical compensation for a casino host in Missouri?

Casino hosts in Missouri can typically expect to earn a salary ranging from $25,000 to $50,000. However, the amount of compensation a host earns can vary depending on the casino's size and location. Hosts at smaller casinos may earn less than their counterparts at larger establishments. Additionally, hosts in rural areas may earn less than those working in more populous areas.

# What are the responsibilities of a casino host in Missouri?

A casino host is responsible for greeting guests and helping them find their way around the casino.
