#  How to make an extra $100 a day by betting on drinks being complimentary at Harrah's New Orleans casino!

Do you enjoy gambling? If so, have you ever thought about how you could make gambling work for you financially as well?

Believe it or not, but it is possible to make an extra $100 a day by betting on drinks being complimentary at Harrah's New Orleans Casino! Here's how:

First, find out what days the casino offers drink comps. Typically, this promotion is offered on weekdays Monday through Thursday. However, it's always best to check with the casino directly to verify.

Next, come up with a betting strategy. You can either bet that drinks will be complimentary for everyone (a "no comp" bet), or you can bet that drinks will be complimentary for selected players (a "comp" bet). For example, if you think that the casino will offer drink comps to only a certain group of players (e.g., Platinum and Diamond members), then you would make a "comp" bet.

Then, visit the casino on the day in question and place your bet. For example, if you're betting that drinks will be complimentary for everyone, then simply hand your cashier a $5 bill and tell them "comps please." If you're betting that drinks will be complimentary for selected players, then present your Harrah's card along with your $5 bill and tell the cashier which group of players you think will get free drinks.

If your prediction is correct and drinks are indeed complimentary for everyone/selected players, then the casino will give you back your $5 bill plus an extra $100! This may seem like an unrealistic scenario, but trust us – it happens all the time at Harrah's New Orleans Casino. In fact, we've seen people win this bet multiple times in a single day!

#  Learn how to turn a simple gamble into complimentary drinks and an extra $100 each day!

For the average person, gambling is simply a way to pass the time or make some extra cash. However, for those looking to take their gambling skills up a notch, there are plenty of ways to do so and still come out on top. Here are just a few tips to turning an average gamble into a money-making opportunity:

1. Choose your games wisely. Not all casino games are created equal – some offer better odds than others. So before you sit down at the blackjack table, do your research and find the game that offers the best chance of winning.

2. Bet big, but not too big. It’s important to bet enough that you have a chance of winning, but not so much that you can’t afford to lose. For most games, betting the minimum gives you the best odds of winning, while still allowing you to make some serious profits if you hit it big.

3. Know when to quit. There’s no point in risking it all when you’re on a winning streak – know when to walk away! Similarly, if things aren’t going your way, it might be wise to cut your losses and move on.

4. Use complimentary drinks wisely. Most casinos offer complimentary drinks (alcoholic or not) as a way to keep players at their tables for longer. So before placing any bets, make sure you have a drink in hand – this will help take the edge off and may give you the boost you need to make that crucial decision.

5. Take advantage of bonus offers. Casinos often offer sign-up bonuses and other incentive programs as a way of attracting new players. So before signing up at any casino, be sure to check out their promotions page and see what kind of offers they have available.
