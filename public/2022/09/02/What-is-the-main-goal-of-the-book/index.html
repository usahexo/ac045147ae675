<h1 id="What-is-Markdown"><a href="#What-is-Markdown" class="headerlink" title="What is Markdown?"></a>What is Markdown?</h1><p>Markdown is a text-based markup language that was created by John Gruber in 2004. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, making it ideal for document formatting and writing.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-Markdown-work"><a href="#How-does-Markdown-work" class="headerlink" title="How does Markdown work?"></a>How does Markdown work?</h1><p>Markdown works by taking plain text input and converting it into formatted HTML output. This makes it an ideal tool for creating web pages and documents, as it doesn’t require any specialized software or knowledge.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-using-Markdown"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-using-Markdown" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of using Markdown?"></a>What are the benefits of using Markdown?</h1><p>Some of the benefits of using Markdown include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity: Markdown is simple to learn and easy to use, making it perfect for those who are new to coding or markup languages.</li>
<li>Speed: Because there is no need to convert markups into HTML when publishing content, publishing with Markdown is often much faster than using other methods.</li>
<li>Versatility: As Markdown can be used to create both static and dynamic content, it is a versatile tool that can be used in a variety of situations.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="What-is-the-audience-for-the-book"><a href="#What-is-the-audience-for-the-book" class="headerlink" title="What is the audience for the book?"></a>What is the audience for the book?</h1><p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the audience for a book can vary greatly depending on the topic and genre of the book. However, in general, the audience for a book tends to be those who are interested in the topic of the book and who are looking for more information about it.</p>
<p>For non-fiction books, the target audience may be people who want to learn about a specific topic or subject, while for fiction books, the audience may be people who are looking for a good story to read. In either case, it is important to consider who your target audience is and what you hope they will get out of reading your book.</p>
<h1 id="What-makes-your-book-different"><a href="#What-makes-your-book-different" class="headerlink" title="What makes your book different?"></a>What makes your book different?</h1><p>This is another question that can vary greatly depending on the topic and genre of the book. However, in general, there are several things that can make a book stand out from others in its category.</p>
<p>Some things that could make a book unique include its writing style, its perspective or point of view, or its approach to the topic it covers. Additionally, if a book is well-written and engaging, it can set itself apart from other books in its genre.</p>

<h1 id="How-dense-is-the-material"><a href="#How-dense-is-the-material" class="headerlink" title="How dense is the material?"></a>How dense is the material?</h1><p>Earth’s atmosphere is mainly composed of nitrogen and oxygen, with a small fraction of argon and carbon dioxide. These gases are at different concentrations depending on the location. For example, the air near the Earth’s surface has much higher levels of nitrogen and oxygen than the air high in the atmosphere. The concentration of a gas in a particular location is called the density.</p>
<p>The concentration of a gas is determined by two factors: the pressure and the temperature. The pressure of a gas is determined by its weight. The more gas there is, the greater the weight. The temperature of a gas determines how fast its molecules fly around. The higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move.</p>
<p>When you put all these together, you can see that different gases have different densities at different locations in Earth’s atmosphere. Nitrogen and oxygen are both diatomic gases, which means that each molecule consists of two atoms joined together. These gases are very common and have relatively low densities near the Earth’s surface. However, as you go higher in the atmosphere, the concentration of these gases decreases because there is less and less weight pushing them down.</p>
<p>Argon is an inert gas, which means that it doesn’t react with other substances. It has a higher density than nitrogen and oxygen because there are more atoms in each molecule. Carbon dioxide is also an inert gas, but it has a much higher density than argon because each molecule contains twice as many atoms as an argon molecule.</p>

This guide is for absolute beginners who have never written a line of code before.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a versatile language that you can use on the front-end and back-end of a website. It can be used to create animations, user interfaces, and dynamic content. However, before we get started coding in JavaScript, let’s first take a look at some of the basics of how the language works.</p>
<h1 id="Variables"><a href="#Variables" class="headerlink" title="Variables"></a>Variables</h1><p>In JavaScript, we store values in variables. A variable is simply a name that we give to a value so that we can reference it later. For example:</p>
<p>var myName &#x3D; “John”; &#x2F;&#x2F; assigns the value John to the variable myName<br>console.log(myName); &#x2F;&#x2F; prints out John</p>
<p>We can also assign values to variables using mathematical operators. For example:</p>
<p>var age &#x3D; 21;<br>var height &#x3D; 68;<br>var weight &#x3D; 180;<br>console.log(age + height + weight); &#x2F;&#x2F; prints out 320</p>
<h1 id="Which-parts-of-JavaScript-are-covered-in-detail"><a href="#Which-parts-of-JavaScript-are-covered-in-detail" class="headerlink" title="Which parts of JavaScript are covered in detail?"></a>Which parts of JavaScript are covered in detail?</h1><p>There are many different aspects of the JavaScript language that can be covered in detail. Different people may have different opinions on what is the most important, but some of the more commonly mentioned topics include:</p>
<p>Variables and data types<br>Arrays and objects<br>Functions<br>Conditionals and loops<br>Scope<br>Closures<br>This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it does provide a starting point for those looking to dive deeper into JavaScript. Let’s take a closer look at each of these topics.</p>
<h1 id="Variables-and-data-types"><a href="#Variables-and-data-types" class="headerlink" title="Variables and data types"></a>Variables and data types</h1><p>Variables are one of the most fundamental concepts in any programming language. In JavaScript, there are three main type of variables - strings, numbers, and booleans. Strings are simply sequences of characters, numbers are just that - numbers, and booleans are true or false values.</p>
<h1 id="Arrays-and-objects"><a href="#Arrays-and-objects" class="headerlink" title="Arrays and objects"></a>Arrays and objects</h1><p>Arrays are collections of data items, indexed by number. For example, the following array contains three items - “cat”, “dog”, “hamster”:<br>[ ‘cat’, ‘dog’, ‘hamster’ ]<br>Objects are similar to arrays, but they can also contain properties and methods. Properties are like variables associated with an object, while methods are functions that can be called on an object. For example, the following object contains a property called “name” and a method called “speak”:<br>{ name: ‘fido’, speak: function() { console.log(‘Woof!’); } }<br>Both arrays and objects can be used to store data in JavaScript.</p>
