        <h1 id="What-is-Sky88"><a href="#What-is-Sky88" class="headerlink" title="What is Sky88?"></a>What is Sky88?</h1><p>Sky88 is a skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It is the tallest building in Southeast Asia and the third-tallest in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Construction"><a href="#Construction" class="headerlink" title="Construction"></a>Construction</h1><p>The tower was designed by Cesar Pelli of architectural firm Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates, and was constructed by Samsung Engineering &amp; Construction. The tower’s construction began on 1 January 1993 and finished on 1 January 1996. The tower’s cost was estimated to be around RM1.6 billion (US$390 million). When completed, it became the world’s tallest concrete building, taking the record from Chicago’s Aqua Tower. </p>
<p>The Sky88 Tower has 88 storeys, comprising office space, a hotel and an observatory at the top. The lower levels of the tower house retail outlets and car parks. </p>
<h1 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h1><p>In 1997, two years after it was completed, Telekom Malaysia moved its headquarters into Sky88 Tower. In 2001, Skybroadband—the country’s first broadband internet service provider—was launched from level 61 of the tower. Also that year, Floor 69 became home to the first MTV South East Asia studio outside of Japan. That studio was later closed in 2006 and replaced with a Counter Strike training facility for Telekom Malaysia’s cyber security unit known as TNBcyberjaya </p>
<p>In 2003, level 80 of the tower became home to one of Southeast Asia’s largest radio stations, Fly FM. The station moved out in 2009 and was replaced byYes 4G, which moved in from Menara Maxis. In 2010, Yes 4G moved out and was replaced by telecommunications company U Mobile.<br>As of 2016, Sky88 Tower is mainly occupied by Telekom Malaysia (Levels 53 to 77), U Mobile (Levels 80 to 88) and several other minor tenants</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-Tennessee-Titans"><a href="#Who-are-the-Tennessee-Titans" class="headerlink" title="Who are the Tennessee Titans?"></a>Who are the Tennessee Titans?</h1><p>Formed in 1960 as the Houston Oilers, the Tennessee Titans are one of the NFL’s youngest franchises. The team played their first season in Houston, Texas before relocating to Nashville, Tennessee in 1997. The Titans are members of the AFC South Division and have won the division title twice (2002 and 2008). The team has also reached the playoffs four times, but have yet to win a championship. </p>
<p>The Titans are led by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Marcus Mariota. Mariota is entering his fifth season with the team and has been a starter since his rookie year. In that time, he has thrown for over 14,000 yards and 95 touchdowns. He is looking to lead the Titans back to the playoffs for the first time since 2016. </p>
<p>The Titans’ home games are played at Nissan Stadium, which can seat up to 69,143 fans. The stadium opened in 1999 and has been home to the Titans ever since. The team’s official colors are navy blue and light blue, hence their nickname “The Bluebirds”. </p>
<p>Key players on the roster include wide receivers Corey Davis and A.J. Brown, running back Derrick Henry, linebacker Rashaan Evans, and cornerback Logan Ryan. </p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-Minnesota-Vikings"><a href="#Who-are-the-Minnesota-Vikings" class="headerlink" title="Who are the Minnesota Vikings?"></a>Who are the Minnesota Vikings?</h1><p>Formed in 1961 as an expansion team, the Minnesota Vikings are one of the NFL’s oldest franchises. The Vikings played their first season in Minneapolis, Minnesota before relocating to suburban Saint Paul in 1984. The Vikings are members of the NFC North Division and have won two conference championships (1969 and 1973) and four division titles (1998, 2009, 2017, 2018).

<h1 id="Who-are-the-Premier-League-teams"><a href="#Who-are-the-Premier-League-teams" class="headerlink" title="Who are the Premier League teams?"></a>Who are the Premier League teams?</h1><p>The Premier League, often referred to as the English Premier League (EPL), is England’s top-level professional association football division. It is made up of 20 teams, and operates a system of promotion and relegation with the Football League.</p>
<p>The reigning champions are Manchester City, who won the title in the 2017-18 season. The club earned 96 points, finishing one point ahead of Liverpool. </p>
<p>The Premier League was founded in 1992, as a replacement for the original Football League First Division. The Premier League has been played since 1992-93 and has been sponsored by Barclays Bank since 2004. </p>
<p>There are 20 teams in the Premier League: 17 from England, 2 from Wales and 1 from Scotland. </p>
<p>The following table shows the teams that have competed in the Premier League since its inception in 1992-93:<br>Arsenal Chelsea Everton Leicester Liverpool Manchester City Manchester United Newcastle Southampton Tottenham Hotspur West Ham United Aston Villa Blackburn Rovers Bolton Wanderers Burnley Cardiff City Charlton Athletic Crystal Palace Fulham Leeds United Middlesbrough Norwich City Portsmouth Queens Park Rangers Reading Sheffield United Sunderland Watford West Bromwich Albion Wolverhampton Wanderers </p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-Premier-League"><a href="#What-is-the-Premier-League" class="headerlink" title="What is the Premier League?"></a>What is the Premier League?</h1><p>The Premier League is the top-level English professional football league.<br>The Premier League was founded on 20 February 1992 and is made up of 20 teams. The first season started in August 1992 and ended in May 1993.<br>The Premier League is a corporation in which the member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches (playing each other twice, once at home and once away). Most games are played on Sundays and Wednesdays, with a few games played on Saturdays.<br>The current champions are Chelsea, who won the title in 2017-2018.</p>
<h1 id="History-of-the-Premier-League"><a href="#History-of-the-Premier-League" class="headerlink" title="History of the Premier League"></a>History of the Premier League</h1><p>The idea for a national top-level football league in England originated with the Football Association (FA) in 1889. However, it was not until 1954 that the FA decided to create such a league, and it was not until 1992 that the Premier League was finally formed.<br>One of the main reasons for the delay was that the Football League – which was created in 1888 and consisted of 92 clubs – was opposed to a breakaway league. Another reason was financial: the Football League received payments totaling £2 million from ITV for its exclusive rights to broadcast matches, while the new Premier League would have to generate its own income.<br>Initially, a number of clubs refused to join the new league, including Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and Liverpool. However, all three clubs eventually changed their minds and joined in time for the launch of the inaugural season in 1992-1993.<br>Ever since its formation, the Premier League has been dominated by a small number of teams: Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea have all been champions more than 10 times since 1992-1993.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-the-Premier-League-work"><a href="#How-does-the-Premier-League-work" class="headerlink" title="How does the Premier League work?"></a>How does the Premier League work?</h1><p>There are 20 teams in the Premier League, which is England’s top division of professional football. The teams are placed in a league table, with the team that finishes first at the top and the team that finishes last at the bottom.</p>
<p>Each team plays 38 matches throughout the season, playing each other twice - once at home and once away. At the end of the season, the team that finishes first is crowned Premier League champions.</p>
<p>The teams that finish in second, third and fourth place also qualify for the UEFA Champions League, Europe’s most prestigious club competition. The teams that finish in fifth and sixth place qualify for the UEFA Europa League.</p>
